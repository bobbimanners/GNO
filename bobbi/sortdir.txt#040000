NAME  
        sortdir  -  tool for sorting directories, converting the case of
        filenames, converting timestamps and testing  the  integrity  of
        individual directories or entire ProDOS filesystems 

SYNOPSIS  
        sortdir [-s xxx -n x -d x -f x -rDwcvVh] directory 

DESCRIPTION  
        The  sortdir  utility  provides tools for sorting and compacting
        ProDOS and GSOS  directories  on  disk  and  performs  integrity
        checking  of  the  structure  of  directories  and entire ProDOS
        filesystems.  sortdir is also able to convert filenames to upper 
        case, lower case or initial  capital  letters.    The  directory
        argument is the starting directory.  


        OPTIONS  


        -s xxx  
                Sorts  the  ProDOS directory (or directories if -r or -D
                is specified.) A sequence of letters  following  the  -s
                flag  specifies  a  sequence of sorting operations to be
                performed.  The directory will be  sorted  according  to
                these sort  fields  in sequence from left to right.  The
                sorting options are as follows: 

                n: Sort by filename, in ascending ASCII order 

                N: Sort by filename, in descending ASCII order 

                i: Sort by filename, in ascending  ASCII  order  -  case
                insensitive 

                I:  Sort  by  filename, in descending ASCII order - case
                insensitive 

                d: Sort by modification date (or  creation  date  if  -c
                flag is given), in ascending order 

                D:  Sort  by  modification  date (or creation date if -c
                flag is given), in descending order 

                t: Sort by file type, in ascending order 

                T: Sort by file type, in descending order 

                f: Sort with folders (directories) at the top 

                F: Sort with folders (directories) at the bottom 

                b: Sort by blocks used in ascending order

SORTDIR (1)            Commands and Applications             SORTDIR (1)



                B: Sort by blocks used in descending order 

                e: Sort by EOF position in ascending order 

                E: Sort by EOF position in descending order 

        -n x  
                Modify the case of ProDOS filenames,  according  to  the
                option flag following the -n flag, as follows: 

                l: Convert filenames to lower case (eg: read.me) 

                u: Convert filenames to upper case (eg: READ.ME) 

                i: Convert filenames to initial upper case (eg: Read.me) 

                c: Convert filenames to camel case (eg: Read.Me) 

        -d x  
                Modify  the  on-disk  format  of  the  modification  and
                creation time  fields,  according  to  the  option  flag
                following the -d flag, as follows: 

                o:  Convert  mtime and ctime fields to the old date/time
                format used from ProDOS 1.0 to 2.4.2 and all versions of 
                GSOS.  

                n: Convert mtime and ctime fields to the  new  date/time
                format used by ProDOS 2.5 and newer versions.  

        -f x  
                Enables  'fix  mode'  which attempts to fix inconsistent
                information in the directory  structure.    The  options
                that may be passed following -f are as follows: 

                y: Answer  'yes' to all prompts.  Be careful, this could
                be dangerous!  

                n: Answer 'no' to all  prompts.    No  repairs  will  be
                attempted.  

                ?: Prompt y/n for each potential repair.  

        -r  
                Enables the  recursive  descent  option.    When  -r  is
                specified, the sortdir utility will process the starting 
                directory  and  will  then   recursively   process   all
                subdirectories in a depth-first manner.  

        -D  
                Enables the  'whole volume' mode.  This mode implies -r.
                Whole volume  mode  processes  all  directories  on  the
                entire   ProDOS   or  GSOS  volume,  starting  from  the
                top-level volume directory.  The starting  directory  is

                used only to determine which volume to process.  Because 
                whole  disk  mode scans the entire volume this mode also
                performs  checking  there  are  no  blocks   marked   as
                allocated on the free list which are in fact unused.  

        -w  
                Enables writing  changes to disk.  The default is not to
                write anything to disk, so this option must be specified 
                explicitly.  

        -c  
                Display the creation time of the files rather  than  the
                modification time.    If  -c  is specified then the date
                sorting options -sd and -sD will also use creation  time
                instead of modification time.  

        -v  
                Enable verbose  output.    This  flag provides much more
                detailed reporting.  

        -V  
                Enable verbose debugging output.  This is  intended  for
                developer use only.  

        -h  
                Display brief usage information.  

        The  sortdir  utility  exits  0  on  success, and >0 if an error
        occurs.  

USAGE  
        sortdir is extremely powerful and supports  many  different  use
        cases.  A few examples are given here.  

        sortdir -snf -w .  

        Sort  the current directory by filename in ascending order, then
        sort the folders to  the  top.    Write  the  changes  to  disk,
        updating the current directory.  

        sortdir -rv /H1 

        Recursively check all directories under volume /H1, with verbose 
        output enabled.  

        sortdir -Dv .  

        Do  whole-volume  check  on  the  current volume, which includes
        checking that no blocks are allocated to more than one  file  or
        directory  and  that all free blocks are listed on the freelist.
        Enable verbose output.  

        sortdir -rc -sD -cl -w /bobbi/devel

SORTDIR (1)            Commands and Applications             SORTDIR (1)



        Sort  all  directories   under   /bobbi/devel   recursively   in
        descending order  of  creation  time.   Convert all filenames to
        lower case.  Write the changes to disk.  

WARNINGS  
        When the -w  option  is  used  to  write  changes  to  disk  any
        malfunction of the  sortdir utility could cause severe directory 
        or  disk  volume  corruption,  which  could result in data loss.
        Always backup any important disks before using sortdir in  write
        mode.  

        The  -w  option  must be passed in order to write any changes to
        disk, including repairs made using the -f 'fix mode'.
